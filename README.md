# AI-Powered Interview Assistant

This project is a web application designed to automate the initial screening process for technical interviews. It provides a dual-interface system for both the candidate (interviewee) and the recruiter (interviewer), creating a seamless and efficient evaluation experience. The entire session is persisted locally, allowing users to resume an in-progress interview at any time.
